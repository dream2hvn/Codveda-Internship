## 📁 List of Notebooks

### 1. **Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.ipynb**

🔧 **Description:**
This notebook prepares the dataset by cleaning and formatting it for further analysis and modeling.

✅ **How to Run:**
- Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom.
- Ensure the required dataset file is available and loaded correctly.
- Verify the transformation results (e.g., no more missing values, consistent formats).

---

### 2. **Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).ipynb**

📈 **Description:**
This notebook performs initial exploration and visualization to understand the structure and distribution of the data.

✅ **How to Run:**
- Run this notebook after completing data cleaning (Task 2).
- Observe the plots and descriptive statistics generated.
- Modify or extend visualizations based on your analysis needs.

---

### 3. **Task 3 - Clustering (Unsupervised Learning).ipynb**

🧩 **Description:**
This notebook applies unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means) to segment the data into clusters based on feature similarity.

✅ **How to Run:**
- Run this after completing EDA to better understand feature relationships.
- Use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
- Review cluster plots and interpret cluster characteristics.

### 4. **Task 3 - Neural Networks with TensorFlow or Keras.ipynb**

🧠 **Description:**
This notebook builds and trains a neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras for classification or regression tasks.

✅ **How to Run:**
- Make sure TensorFlow and Keras are installed.
- Run the notebook after data preprocessing is complete.
- Examine the model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation.
- Use GPU acceleration (if available) for faster training.
